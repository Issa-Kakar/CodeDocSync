"""
AST Parser Module for CodeDocSync.

This module is responsible for parsing Python source code into an
Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). It will extract key information about the code
structure, such as modules, classes, functions, their signatures (parameters,
return types), and associated docstrings.

This forms the foundational layer of CodeDocSync's analysis capabilities.

# This file is intentionally left empty for now.
# Implementation will begin here, focusing on traversing the AST
# to build a structured representation of the source code.
