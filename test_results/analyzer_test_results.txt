Analyzer Module Test Results
============================

Total: 31 tests
Passed: 15 (48.4%)
Failed: 1 (3.2%)
Errors: 15 (48.4%)

Issues Found:
1. LLM Analyzer Tests (15 errors)
   - All LLM analyzer tests fail with API key validation error
   - API key format validation expects "sk-" prefix
   - Test environment uses mock keys that fail validation

2. Configuration Validation Test (1 failure)
   - Same API key validation issue

3. Rule Engine Tests (15 passed)
   - All rule engine tests pass successfully
   - Performance meets requirements (<5ms per function)
   - Zero false positives for perfect matches

Root Causes:
- LLM tests need mocking of API key validation
- Tests are trying to create actual LLM connections with test keys
- Rule engine works perfectly without external dependencies

Recommendations:
1. Mock the LLMConfig._validate_api_key method in tests
2. Add environment variable to disable API key validation in test mode
3. Consider using dependency injection for easier testing
