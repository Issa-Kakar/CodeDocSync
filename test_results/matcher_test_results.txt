Matcher Module Test Results
===========================

Total: 34 tests
Passed: 31 (91.2%)
Failed: 3 (8.8%)

Issues Found:
1. Contextual Matcher - Namespace conflicts
   - Same function names across different modules not properly resolved
   - Issue: Detecting differences between api.v1.users.get_user and api.v2.users.get_user

2. Contextual Matcher - Cross-package documentation
   - Confidence score too low (0.63) when matching documentation from package __init__.py
   - Expected: >= 0.7 confidence for package-level documentation

3. Direct Matcher - Performance consistency
   - High performance variance across runs (134.4% deviation)
   - Likely due to system load or caching effects

Root Causes:
- Namespace conflict resolution needs improvement
- Confidence scoring for cross-package matches is too conservative
- Performance test may be too strict for Windows environment

Recommendations:
1. Improve namespace handling in contextual matcher
2. Adjust confidence scoring for package-level documentation
3. Relax performance consistency requirements or add warm-up runs
